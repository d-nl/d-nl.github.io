I'm a Cybersecurity graduate from Penn State!

This is my website, which serves as a portfolio for my personal and academic projects. 

They are mostly IT and Cybersecurity-related homelabs. If you'd like to see them, please visit the "Projects" section in the top navigation bar.

I'm currently searching for an opportunity to improve my technical skills with! If you'd like to read up on my experience, please see down below.

# Experience

## Professional Experience 

My most relevant and recent IT experience was at the ITS department at Penn State Lehigh Valley.

As an **IT User Support Specialist**, I was responsible for troubleshooting and providing support for hardware, software, printers, audio-visual equipment including Zoom Rooms, projectors, and speakers. I was trained and primarily worked with the **ServiceNow** ticketing system.

Most prominently, I was responsible for a networking project involving ethernet recabling over 7 data closets for the campus. In that project, I constructed and terminated Cat6 ethernet cables, remapped, organized, and documented configurations and switch ports, and tested network connections to ensure consistent uptime and reduce troubleshooting times. I developed a comprehensive network map to streamline maintainance, asset tracking, and future network expansion for the campus.

Beyond that, I have had years of experience in customer service and retail roles in both Fine Wine & Good Spirits stores and BJ's Wholesale Club as a clerk and cashier respectively.

## Certifications

In my free time, I try to study for certifications. My most recent was Microsoft's Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900). I currently hold:
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
- Microsoft Certified 365 Fundamentals
- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA A+
- and Penn State's own National Security Agency certificate obtained as apart my completion of courses there as specified and approved by the NSA and Department of Homeland Security! Read more about this [here](https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/information-sciences-technology/national-security-agency-certificate/).

I also hold various eLearning course certifications from Cybersecurity companies including Cisco's Learning Network, Splunk's free courses, and Palo Alto's Beacon training platform. To see a list, visit the "eLearning" page at the top navigation bar.
