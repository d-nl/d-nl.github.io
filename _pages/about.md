My most relevant and recent IT experience was at the ITS department at Penn State Lehigh Valley.

As an **IT User Support Specialist**, I was responsible for troubleshooting and providing support for hardware, software, printers, and audio-visual equipment including Zoom Rooms, projectors, and speakers. I was trained and primarily worked with the **ServiceNow** ticketing system.

I was responsible for projects including ethernet recabling in data closets, Microsoft 365 phone installation (Telephony), asset inventory management, manual computer updates and hardware replacement. 

Beyond that, I have had years of experience in customer service and retail roles in both Fine Wine & Good Spirits stores and BJ's Wholesale Club as a clerk and cashier respectively.
